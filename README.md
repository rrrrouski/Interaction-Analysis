# Interaction Analysis with Apple Watch Data

In this project, I will present observations of which kind of behavioural patterns affect sleep quality and sleeping patterns based on Apple Watch data. In addition, I will create a model prediction if an individual is either Asleep or Awake at a certain time. The data used in my project was collected in the study by Walch et al. (2019). The data consists of motion (in g), heart rate (in bpm), and steps from Apple Watch data, as well as labeled sleep scored from polysomnography (0-5, wake = 0, N1 = 1, N2 = 2, N3 = 3, REM = 5). Stages N1, N2, and N3 refer to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages or the deeper sleep phases, and REM refers to rapid eye movement sleep.

## Installation and Usage

The project code is found in a Jupyter Notebook file and does not require specific installation. The code does not require running. If you want to run the code, run each cell by pressing Shift + Enter. Download the data files in the same folder as the project code.

## Documentation

The documentation is found under the Documentation file. It includes a broad explanation and motivation for the project, problem formulation, dataset handling, methods used, as well as results and discussions.
